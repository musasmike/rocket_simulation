First, I would like to thank Tim for putting this tutorial together. His YouTube channel has been a great resource of me
to learn Python and advance my programming skills. I coded along with him on this project, but I alter it a little bit.
The aim of this project was to create a Python UI interface using pygame to simulate the gravitational 
effect between the spacecraft and a planet. In this app, I changed the initial planet, which was jupyter and replaced it
with two planets, Neptune and Mars. If you want to know more on how you can do this, I recommend Tim's 
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTfwhmHVpqM&list=LL&index=2&ab_channel=TechWithTim).
