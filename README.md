First, I would like to thank Tim for putting this tutorial together. His YouTube channel has been a great resource of me
to learn Python and advance my programming skills. I coded along with him on this project, but I alter it a little bit.
The aim of this project was to create a Python UI interface using pygame to simulate the gravitational 
effect between the spacecraft and a planet.
